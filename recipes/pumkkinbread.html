<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This fall favorite Homemade Pumpkin Bread recipe has been a fan favorite since 2014. <strong>No mixer required!</strong> Packed with cinnamon spice and loads of pumpkin flavor, the days of bland pumpkin pies are behind us.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and 3/4 cups <strong>all-purpose flour</strong></li>
        <li>1 teaspoon <strong>baking soda</strong></li>
        <li>2 teaspoons <strong>ground cinnamon</strong></li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon <strong>ground nutmeg</strong></li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon <strong>ground cloves</strong></li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon <strong>ground ginger</strong></li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon <strong>salt</strong></li>
        <li>2 large <strong>eggs</strong>, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 cup <strong>granulated sugar</strong></li>
        <li>3/4 cup packed light or dark <strong>brown sugar</strong></li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups <strong>pumpkin puree</strong> (canned or fresh)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup <strong>vegetable oil</strong> (<em>canola oil, or melted coconut oil</em>)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup <strong>orange juice</strong></li>
        <li>2/3 cup semi-sweet <strong>chocolate chips</strong></li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Adjust the oven rack to the <em>lower third</em> position and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C). Lowering the oven rack prevents the top of your bread from browning too much, too soon. Grease a metal 9x5-inch loaf pan with non-stick spray. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, and salt together until combined. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, granulated sugar, and brown sugar together until combined. Whisk in the pumpkin, oil, and orange juice. Pour these wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and <em>gently</em> mix together using a rubber spatula or a wooden spoon. There will be a few lumps. <strong>Do not over mix!</strong> <em>Gently</em> fold in the chocolate chips, if including.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake for 60-65 minutes, making sure to loosely cover the bread with aluminum foil halfway through to prevent the top from getting too brown. The bread is done when a toothpick inserted ini the center comes out clean with only a few small moist crumbs. This may be before or after 60-65 minutes depending on your oven, so begin checking every 5 minutes around the 55-minute mark.</li>
        <li>Allow the bread to cool completely in the pan on a wire rack before removing and slicing.</li>
        <li>Cover and store leftover pumpkin bread at room temperature for up to 3-4 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week.</li>
    </ol>
