<p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose <strong>flour</strong></li>
        <li>2 teaspoons <strong>baking powder</strong></li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon <strong><em>fine</em> sea salt</strong></li>
        <li>2 sticks <strong>unsalted butter</strong></li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups <strong>granulated sugar</strong></li>

        <li>1 teaspoon <strong>vanilla extract</strong></li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line making sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt to combine.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, use an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium-high speed to beat the butter and 1 1/4 cups sugar until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla, and beat until combined. Slowly beat in the flour mixture.</li>
        <li>Place the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar in a shallow dish. Using an ice cream scoop, divide the dough into balls, then roll in sugar to coat evenly. Place the dough balls on the prepared baking sheets and flatten them slightly, spacing 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies set and begin to brown. Cool for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.</li>
